## Concept: Personal Website MVP as a Learning Project

### Purpose

This project was created as a way to investigate the effort involved in coding and maintaining a personal website from scratch. As a Product Manager with background experience in development, I wanted to re-familarize myself with the technical side of building software.

In addition to exploring software development, this project gave me an opportunity to practice version control using Git and to experiment with creating technical documentation using a docs-as-code approach. It is a learning sandbox for technical growth.

### Why Jekyll?

I chose to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because it integrates easily with GitHub Pages and allowed me to focus re-learning how to set up my local dev setup.

### Why Docs-as-Code?

While this website is a skelton of what I wanted to include, I wanted to practice the **docs-as-code** approach: writing Markdown documentation, managing it with Git, and keeping it version-controlled alongside the project using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

### Takeaways

This project helped me learn:
- How to structure documentation folders
- How to use MkDocs for lightweight technical documentation
- Documentation not only helps others understand the project but also serves as a reference for me, making it easier to remember what I did during development.
