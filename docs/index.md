## Personal Website MVP Documentation

This is the documentation for my personal website, created to explore docs-as-code and technical writing workflows. 

The site is built using [GitHub pages & Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), while I created this documentation using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to practice the docs-as-code workflow.
